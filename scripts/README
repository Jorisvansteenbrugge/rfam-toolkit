------
A collection of tools to assist non-coding RNA gene annotation in multiple 
datasets(sequence databases(RNAcentral),Genomes) with Infernal v1.1.1 
(http://infernal.janelia.org) and Rfam 12.0.

Designed to support both local installation as well as utilizing IBM's LSF platform.
   
Requirements:
------------

1. python 2.7
2. Infernal 1.1.1
3. Rfam 12.0

Files:
-----
1. rfam_scanner.py:  A tool designed to support Rfam scanning both locally 
                     as well as utilizing IBM's LSF platform.


rfam_scanner:
HOWTO:
-----

1. Organize inputs (cm_dir,seq_dir,out_dir)
   cm_dir:  A family directory containing the covariance models of preference
   seq_dir: A directory containing a collection of fasta files (.fa) or a number 
            of sub-directories of fasta (.fa) files. Use -m option for the 
            sub_directories otherwise the code assumes it is a 
   out_dir: The destination directory for the output
   
   -m   Work on multiple datasets (seq_dir in seq_dir/proj/seq.fa format)
   
2. Set CMSCAN_EXEC/CMSEARCH_EXEC to point to the correct directories 	 

./rfam_scanner /path/to/cm_dir /path/to/seq_dir /path/to/out_dir [-m] 

LSF Requirements:
----------------

1. Pre-generated job group
2. Set the path to Infernal executables
3. Set MEM, TMP_MEM, LSF = True, CPU ()
